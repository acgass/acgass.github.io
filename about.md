#### Hello, my name is Anna and I'm glad you're here.
After having spent a few years in the industry, I figured out if I wanted to learn and use a diverse set of technology I would have to start developing side projects.
I have a couple of languages, frameworks, and technologies I would like to learn:
- Python
- React and React Native
- Amazon Web Services
- ... and many more

I plan on chronicling my journey here, and I will probably sprinkle in some podcast recommendations.
I hope you enjoy your time here, and learn something a long the way. Without further ado...

**Ladies and Gentleman, this is Side Project No.1**
