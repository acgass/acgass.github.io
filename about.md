Hello, I'm glad you're here.
-----------

My name is Anna and I am a software developer based in the midwest. After having spent a few years in the industry, I decided to start developing side projects to learn new technologies,
and also just to give to give myself something to do after work. Here are just a few of the things I would like to learn over the course of this endeavor:

\- Python

\- React and React Native

\- Amazon Web Services

\- ... and many more

I plan on chronicling my journey here, and I will probably sprinkle in some podcast recommendations.
I hope you enjoy your time here, and learn something a long the way. Without further ado...

**Ladies and Gentleman, this is Side Project No.1**
