title: Hello, I'm glad you're here
---
My name is Anna and I am a software developer based in the midwest. After having spent a few years in the industry, I decided to start developing side projects to learn new technologies,
and also just to give to give myself something to do after work. Here are just a few of the things I would like to learn over the course of this endeavor:
<ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
    <li>
        Python
    </li>
    <li>
        React and React Native
    </li>
    <li>
        Amazon Web Services
    </li>
    <li>
        ... and many more
    </li>
</ul>

I plan on chronicling my journey here, and I will probably sprinkle in some podcast recommendations.
I hope you enjoy your time here, and learn something a long the way.
