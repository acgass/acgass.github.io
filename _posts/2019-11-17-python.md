Maybe if I had been a better student, I would have enjoyed those classes more, but after college I got a job doing java development so I never really put much more thought in to learning anything else until recently. 

I relized I always say I got into this field to be constantly learning something new, but I have never actually tried to learn a language outside of Java. So, I sat down and started learning python.

I have only been trying python out for two weeks in consistently, so I still get lost, but overall I have enjoyed it. 

I hate having to come up with things to code just to learn something, so I found a kata online that I could try to solve in python. After some searching I tried to
