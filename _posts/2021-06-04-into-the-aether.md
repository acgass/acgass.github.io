During this past year, I have gotten back into gaming. I have had a Nintendo Switch for a while, but I hadn't really used it that much in the past few years. However with a drastic reduction of social activities, I found myself with a lot more time on my hands and picked up my Switch again. This sent me into a spiral of spending hours engrossed in amazing games and eventually led to me building a gaming PC. (Shout out to everyone who helped me curate my parts, assemble the computer, and get it set up) After diving back into the world of video games, I needed a way to discover new games to play. I tried watching Twitch for a while, but I found the top games played never changed too much and I had a hard time discovering many games. I then turned back to podcasts to seek out recommendations. I found several shows that I enjoy, however Into the Aether quickly became my new binge listen.

Into the Aether is a self-described "low key video game podcast." The hosts, Stephen Hilger and Brendon Bigley, bring games they are enjoying that week and talk about what drew them to the game, give insight into the mechanics, and offer comedic commentary on the plot. Once a month, they release a long form episode that takes a deep-dive into a single game. While those episodes are time intensive to listen to, they are worth every single second especially if you also love the game being examined. The show strives to produce positive content, so if they bring a game to the show that is an automatic queue that they would recommend the game. I love that Stephen and Brendon never take themselves too seriously, and the cozy vibe they create for the listener. If you want to dive Into the Aether, here are some of my personal favorites episodes:

- Saying "Bug Fables" Like That (feat. Bug Fables, Minecraft Dungeons, and Animal Crossing)
- More Like RogueLOVES (feat. Splunky 2 & Hades)
- Monster Hunter: World, May 2020 Bonus
- Stardew Valley, November Bonus

Another great way to get into the show is to just search for whatever game you are currently enjoying or curious about. Chances are you will find an episode on it. I hope you enjoy the show as much as I do, and let it keep you company even as the world starts to open up again.
