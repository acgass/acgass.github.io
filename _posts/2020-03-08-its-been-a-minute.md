There are only a handful of podcasts that I know exactly when they will be released, but It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders is one of them. (It's also one of the few I have attended live.) Between the long form interviews on Tuesdays and the weekly wrap on Fridays, this podcast fills my week with informative and fun content. I have to admit the weekly wrap episodes are my favorite. Sam and two guest panelists gather to recap the week of news. They not only talk about the well broadcasted stories from the week, but the group also shines a light on some lesser known stories. To top off the show, they play voice recordings of listeners telling Sam what the best part of their week was. You will laugh, you might cry, but you will always end the show with a warm feeling in your chest.

If you want to start listening to the show, start with the most recent weekly wrap, but then dive into some of his Tuesday interview episodes. Each interview is unique, thanks to the guests and Sam's interview style. His style will make you want to participate in the conversation and you will be talking back to your audio device in no time. I have found new books, and new perspectives through these interviews. Here are a few of my favorite interview episodes, in no particular order:

- Nick Kroll on 'Olympic Dreams' and 'Big Mouth'
- Broadway Playwright Jeremy O. Harris on 'Slave Play'
- HBO's 'Los Espookys' star Ana Fabrega
- 'Atlanta' star Brian Tyree Henry

Go, give this podcast a listen, you won't regret it.
